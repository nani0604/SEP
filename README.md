### **Affordable Housing and Tenant Finder**

---

### **Aim:**  
To design and develop an efficient and user-friendly platform that connects tenants with landlords for affordable housing. The system should address issues of trust, transparency, and accessibility in the housing rental process, particularly targeting students, working professionals, and low-income groups.

---

### **Problem Statement:**  
The rental housing market in India faces significant challenges, including:  
1. **Lack of Transparency:** Tenants struggle to find verified properties, and landlords face issues finding trustworthy tenants.  
2. **Inefficient Communication:** Traditional methods of communication between landlords and tenants are time-consuming.  
3. **Accessibility Issues:** Many users, especially in lower-income groups, lack access to reliable platforms to find affordable housing.  
4. **Roommate Matching:** Shared housing solutions are often disorganized and lack compatibility checks.  
5. **Payment and Documentation:** Managing rental payments and agreements manually is cumbersome and error-prone.

**Proposed Solution:**  
Develop a platform where:  
- Landlords can list their properties with verified details.  
- Tenants can find housing using advanced search filters.  
- Automated features like roommate matching, rental agreements, and secure online payments simplify the process.

### **Model Used: Agile Process Model**  

**Reason for Selection:**  
1. The **Agile Process Model** is iterative, making it suitable for incorporating user feedback during development.  
2. Housing needs and user preferences may vary, requiring frequent updates and refinements.  
3. Agile ensures quick delivery of an MVP (Minimum Viable Product) while enabling the addition of advanced features later.
